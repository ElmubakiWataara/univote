# University Online Voting System - Final Architecture & Development Reference

**Project Name:** University Voting System (Local LAN Deployment)  
**Deployment Type:** Locally hosted on a dedicated server machine, accessed via LAN (no internet required)  
**Tech Stack:** Node.js + Express (Backend), React (Frontend), PostgreSQL (Database)  
**Date:** March 2026

## 1. System Overview

This is a secure, supervised online voting system for university elections.  
The entire system runs on a **single local server** on the university LAN.

### Core Flow (Admin-Mediated Token)

- Students approach an **admin desk** and provide their **Student ID**.
- Admin logs into the Admin Dashboard and generates a **one-time token** for that Student ID.
- Admin writes the token on paper and hands it to the student.
- Student goes to a **voting station** (any computer on the LAN), opens the voting website, enters the token.
- System validates the token, issues a short-lived JWT, and allows the student to cast **one vote**.
- After voting, the token is marked as used and the voter is flagged as `has_voted = true`.
- Only admins can generate tokens. Super Admin has additional controls.

**Key Features:**

- Strict one-person-one-vote enforcement
- Full audit trail (who generated token, who voted, when)
- Election can be turned ON/OFF only by Super Admin
- All operations happen locally on the LAN

**Components:**

- **Voting Server Machine**: Runs Node.js backend, serves built React frontend, and hosts PostgreSQL.
- **Admin Stations**: Computers used by election officials to generate tokens.
- **Voting Stations**: Computers where students enter tokens and cast votes.
- **Local Network**: All communication happens over LAN (HTTP/HTTPS on local IP).

## 3. Deployment Instructions (Local LAN)

1. Install Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Git on the server machine.
2. Clone the project and run `npm install` in both backend and frontend folders.
3. Build React frontend: `cd frontend && npm run build`
4. Configure Express to serve static files from `frontend/build`.
5. Bind server to all interfaces:
   ```js
   app.listen(PORT, "0.0.0.0", () => {
     console.log(`Server running on http://0.0.0.0:${PORT}`);
     console.log(`Access from LAN: http://YOUR_SERVER_LOCAL_IP:${PORT}`);
   });
   ```
6. Find server IP using `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ip addr show` (Linux/macOS).
7. Students and admins access the system via `http://192.168.x.x:3000`
8. Recommended: Use PM2 to keep the server running: `pm2 start server.js --name voting-server`

**Security Note:** Use a dedicated election Wi-Fi network with a strong password. Consider self-signed HTTPS for better security.

## 4. Database Schema (PostgreSQL)

```sql
-- Admins
CREATE TABLE admins (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(20) CHECK (role IN ('admin', 'superadmin')) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Voters
CREATE TABLE voters (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    full_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100),
    department VARCHAR(50),
    has_voted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Tokens (Admin-generated)
CREATE TABLE tokens (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    voter_id INTEGER REFERENCES voters(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    token_value VARCHAR(64) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    generated_by INTEGER REFERENCES admins(id) NOT NULL,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    used BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Candidates
CREATE TABLE candidates (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    position VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    bio TEXT,
    photo_url TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Votes (Immutable)
CREATE TABLE votes (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    voter_id INTEGER REFERENCES voters(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    candidate_id INTEGER REFERENCES candidates(id),
    voted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    ip_address INET,
    UNIQUE (voter_id)
);

-- Election Settings (Single row)
CREATE TABLE election_settings (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    allow_live_results BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    updated_by INTEGER REFERENCES admins(id),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Audit Logs
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    action VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    actor_id INTEGER,
    actor_role VARCHAR(20),
    details JSONB,
    ip_address INET,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Important Constraints:**

- `votes.voter_id` has `UNIQUE` constraint → enforces one vote per voter.
- All critical operations must use database transactions.

## 5. Key API Endpoints

### Admin Authentication & Token Generation

- `POST /api/auth/admin-login`  
  Body: `{ "username": "...", "password": "..." }`  
  Returns: Admin JWT

- `POST /api/admin/generate-token`  
  Headers: `Authorization: Bearer <admin-jwt>`  
  Body: `{ "student_id": "U2023001" }`  
  Returns: `{ "token": "a1b2c3...", "expires_in": 900, "voter_name": "..." }`

### Student Voting

- `POST /api/auth/verify-token`  
  Body: `{ "token": "a1b2c3..." }`  
  Returns: Voter JWT + voter info

- `POST /api/vote`  
  Headers: `Authorization: Bearer <voter-jwt>`  
  Body: `{ "candidate_id": 5 }`  
  Returns: Success message

### Other Endpoints

- `GET /api/candidates` → Protected by voter JWT
- `GET /api/results` → Controlled by election settings
- `POST /api/super/toggle-election` → Super Admin only

## 6. Voting Process (Step-by-Step)

1. Student tells admin their **Student ID**.
2. Admin logs in → goes to "Generate Token" → enters Student ID → clicks Generate.
3. Admin receives token on screen, writes it down, and hands it to student.
4. Student goes to voting station → opens site → enters token.
5. System validates token → issues short-lived JWT.
6. Student selects candidate and submits vote.
7. Backend processes vote in a **transaction**:
   - Check election active
   - Check voter not voted
   - Insert vote
   - Set `has_voted = true`
   - Mark token `used = true`
   - Log action
8. Student sees confirmation.

## 7. Security Measures

- Token generation restricted to authenticated admins only.
- Cryptographically secure token (`crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex')`).
- JWT for session management (short expiry for voters).
- Database transactions for vote + has_voted update.
- UNIQUE constraint on votes.voter_id.
- Full audit logging (including which admin generated each token).
- Physical supervision of admin desk and voting stations.

│   └── package.json
├── docker-compose.yml   (optional)
└── voting-system-architecture.md   ← This file
```

**Token Generation Tip (Backend):**

```js
const crypto = require("crypto");
const tokenValue = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString("hex");
```

**Transaction Example (PostgreSQL + Prisma or pg):**
Use `BEGIN; ... COMMIT;` or Prisma `$transaction()` for vote submission.

**Development Tips:**

- Use environment variables for JWT secret, database URL, and port.
- Implement rate limiting on token generation and vote endpoints.
- Add input validation (express-validator or Zod).
- For voting stations, consider kiosk-mode browsers (full screen, limited navigation).
- Test the full flow: admin token generation → student token entry → voting.

## 9. Super Admin Special Functions

- Toggle election ON/OFF
- Manage other admin accounts
- View complete audit logs
- Emergency reset (if needed, with heavy logging)

**This document contains the complete final architecture** based on the agreed requirements:

- Locally hosted on LAN
- Token generated **only by admins**
- Token written down and handed to students
- Students input token on voting screen to vote
- Monolith architecture with Node.js, Express, React, and PostgreSQL

```
